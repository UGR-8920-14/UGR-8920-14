            <h1>Hello Everyone </h1>
            <p>Welcome to my website!

                My name is Ahmed. I am a student at AAiT, where I am studying software engineering. I live a simple life, but I enjoy traveling and playing sports, especially football. I have also achieved some things that I am proud of, and you can read about them on the following pages.
                
                I am passionate about software engineering. I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and creating new things. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn new things.
                
                I am also a big fan of sports. I especially enjoy playing football. I love the competition and the camaraderie of being part of a team.
                
                I love to travel and experience new cultures. I always learn something new on each trip. 
                I love animals.
                
                I am grateful for the opportunities that I have been given. I am determined to make the most of them and achieve my goals.
